### Python
* Five basic keys in programming language are variable, looping, conditions, function, input and output
## Variable
* Declaring variable is the most easiest thing in python. But it would be pretty nice to put meaningful name. No need to say is it string, integer or something. There are needs three thing to declare a variable. 
1. Name, 
2. Equal sign, 
3. Value
* Number: It can be integer, float, double. But no need to mention it while declaring, it is the power of Python.
* String: A good combination of character inside the double/single quotation mark "Diti Rani Dey". You can join multiple string using + sign. Also you can break a string into multiple lines using \n. 
* Dynamic String: Exactly, we use f string for dynamic string in Python. By the way, what is dynamic string? It refers a string that can be evaluated in a dynamic context. Example, f "My name is {name}, my age is {age}". Otherwise string cannot concatenate a int with string. See code..
* Boolean: To express True or False value. Like, is it popular? True or False. In binary true is 1 and false is 0. Use capital letter for True/False. 
* By the way, are you worried about to know what type of variable are you declared or you teammate declared? Python also makes it easy. Just using "type" keyword to know the type of variable. See code. 
## Input
Taking input is also easy in Python. You just use input keyword to take a input from users. Taking input but not showing? Because you are not storing it. So declare a variable with to store input value. Like, age = input('your age please: ') But you are taking all input as a string, so you have to convert it according to your code.
