### Python
* Five basic keys in programming language are variable, looping, conditions, function, input and output
## Variable
* Declaring variable is the most easiest thing in python. But it would be pretty nice to put meaningful name. No need to say is it string, integer or something. There are needs three thing to declare a variable. 
1. Name, 
2. Equal sign, 
3. Value
* Number: It can be integer, float, double. But no need to mention it while declaring, it is the power of Python.
* String: A good combination of character inside the double/single quotation mark "Diti Rani Dey". You can join multiple string using + sign. Also you can break a string into multiple lines using \n. 
* Dynamic String: Exactly, we use f string for dynamic string in Python. By the way, what is dynamic string? It refers a string that can be evaluated in a dynamic context. Example, f "My name is {name}, my age is {age}". Otherwise string cannot concatenate a int with string. See code..
* Boolean: To express True or False value. Like, is it popular? True or False. In binary true is 1 and false is 0. Use capital letter for True/False. 
* By the way, are you worried about to know what type of variable are you declared or you teammate declared? Python also makes it easy. Just using "type" keyword to know the type of variable. See code. 
## Input
Taking input is also easy in Python. You just use input keyword to take a input from users. Taking input but not showing? Because you are not storing it. So declare a variable with to store input value. Like, age = input('your age please: ') But you are taking all input as a string, so you have to convert it according to your code. 
## Operator
1. < = less than
2. > = greater than
3. <= = less than equal to
4. >= = greater than equal to 
5. == equal 
6. != not equal
## Condition
* In python we are checking one condition with the if word, if we need more condition we use elif word. And if we think all conditions are giving still can be different we use else words. Look in our language how many time we used if to state our express like that computer language do. So, do not worry use if/elif/else to make your code more specific. But do not forget to use colon after a condition and  you must concern regard putting space correctly. See code. 
## Loop
* Do you want to show 100 data within in 4 lines? So, loop is here for you. Loop is actually use to iterate each element of an array or object. For using loop, firstly you need to initialize a number variable. Then set you condition, what you want to execute, for executing the loop perfectly need to set increase or decrease statement. If condition is true loop will check and execute the statement inside the loop, otherwise it will not execute the code inside the loop.
1. while loop
* Continue vs Break: if condition meets it demand break will be executed and loop will be stop. Continue will work when you put a condition it will show its falsy value actually. See code to get more.
2. For loop
3. Do while loop
## FUnction
*  A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions allow you to organize your code into modular and manageable pieces, making it easier to read, maintain, and debug.
     * def: This keyword is used to start the function definition.
     * Function body: This is where you write the actual code that the function will execute. It consists of one or more statements that define the behavior of the function.
     * return: This keyword is used to send a value back from the function to the caller. It is optional, and a function can have zero or more return statements. If there is no return statement, the function returns None by default.
Functions are a fundamental concept in Python programming, and they play a key role in writing clean and maintainable code. They can be as simple or as complex as needed to accomplish your programming tasks. See code
## Tuple & Set: 
a group of numbers we can store. In the case of set you can modify and updated. But tuple is immutable so you cannot update, modify or change any number. If you store anything mutable inside a tuple you can modify.
